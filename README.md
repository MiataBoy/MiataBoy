I am a moderator of the [aternos discord](https://chat.aternos.org) and a helper on the [aternos forums](https://board.aternos.org). I have an interest in providing support to people as well as programming, writing and other things. I rarely have time for games anymore so if you are my friend and i say no to playing a game, don't look surprised.
